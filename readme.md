# originpro Python package

This package contains a high-level API for interacting with the Origin software via the Origin Automation Server COM interface. Functionality includes (but is not limited to) reading, writing, and modifying data and creating and exporting graphs. An instance of Origin is launched (either visible or hidden) when using this package.

```
pip install originpro
```

## About this Repository

Although official documentation is available, I am cloning the python package source here (under its original copyright and license) because source code can be more informative in that it is searchable and reveals functionality that remains undocumented.
